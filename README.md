# ember-module-snippets
Snippets to make importing Ember modules a snap in VSCode. 

All of these snippets are preceeded by a `E.` (E-period)
Where you might have in the past said `Ember.get` type `E.get` followed by `ctrl-space` to get these artisinal, grass-fed, snippets for Ember.js

The Ember.js [Module Unification](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0143-module-unification.md) project is an important precursor to unlocking a good bit of future functionality.

The data for these snippets is based on: 
https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-rfc176-data
And the raw json version:
